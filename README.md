# Min sample size for correlations
 
This code calculates the sample size n necessary to obtain correlations whose confidence interval does not include 0, depending on
correlation strength and correlation type, following equations from:

Bonett and Wright (2000), Sample size requirements for estimating Â¨Pearson, Kendall and Spearman correlations, 
Psychometrika, 65(1), 23-2

Code is called approximationOfnForR.m, tested with Matlab R2020b and results can be read in the command window, in the pdf file:
